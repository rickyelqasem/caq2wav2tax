# caq2wav2tzx
Mattel Aquarius CAQ file converter 

CAQ2WAV by James Tamer was single conversion only. Thanks James for giving us access to the source code.
2CAQ2WAV a command line version was  modified by Rafael Molina Chasserot to allow scripting, better wav conversion and TZX output

Ricky El-Qasem - Built the GUI known as CAQ2WAV2TZX . Now multiple caq files can be converted

NOTE: select 11025 on the wav quality if you plan to also convert to TZX. 

NOTE: wav is inverted and will not work on emulator -  will look at fixing later...
